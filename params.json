{"google":"","body":"Footballmetrics\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\nThis package provides methods to evaluate football data.\r\nThe package contains three modules: rankings, pythagoreans and drafttools.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nThe module can easily be installed in the standard way by unzipping (or untaring) it followed by:\r\n\t\r\n\t>>> python setup.py install\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nA HTML documentation may be found in the doc folder. Simply open it by double-clicking index.html.\r\n\r\nFootballmetrics.rankings\r\n------------------------\r\nThis is an implementation of a ranking system that is based on that of Jeff Sagarin from usatoday.com.\r\nI used information found from all around the web and connected them to my own ranking system.\r\nThe rankings module provides an easy way to produce fast and reliable results.\r\n\r\nFootballmetrics.pythagoreans\r\n----------------------------\r\nThe Pythagorean expectation is a way to measure, how often a team should have won based one there scored points\r\nand the scores they suffered from their opponents. It was originally invented by Bill James for application in\r\nbaseball, but quickly adopted for other sports such as American Football.\r\nThis module implements three different methods of the Pythagorean expectation: the classical method, the Pythagenport\r\nformula and the Pythagenpat formula. In principle, it is also possible to define an own formula with this module.\r\n\r\nFooballmetrics.drafttools:\r\n--------------------------\r\nThe latest addition to the Footballmetrics package offers a way to quickly get the value of a draft based on the\r\ndraft value chart. Also the other direction is possible, receiving the draft pick from a given value.\r\n\r\nWarranty:\r\n---------\r\nThis module comes with absolutely no warranty! It was developed for private use only. The author takes _absolutely_\r\nno responsibility for the use of this module, not even that it works in the expected way.","note":"Don't delete this file!
