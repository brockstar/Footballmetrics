Documentation
-------------
A HTML documentation may be found in the doc folder. Simply open it by double-clicking index.html.

Footballmetrics.rankings
------------------------
This is an implementation of a ranking system that is based on that of Jeff Sagarin from usatoday.com.
I used information found from all around the web and connected them to my own ranking system.
The rankings module provides an easy way to produce fast and reliable results.

Footballmetrics.pythagoreans
----------------------------
The Pythagorean expectation is a way to measure, how often a team should have won based one there scored points
and the scores they suffered from their opponents. It was originally invented by Bill James for application in
baseball, but quickly adopted for other sports such as American Football.
This module implements three different methods of the Pythagorean expectation: the classical method, the Pythagenport
formula and the Pythagenpat formula. In principle, it is also possible to define an own formula with this module.

Fooballmetrics.drafttools:
--------------------------
The latest addition to the Footballmetrics package offers a way to quickly get the value of a draft based on the
draft value chart. Also the other direction is possible, receiving the draft pick from a given value.
